          Music is one of my dearest passions. I love listening to music,
          playing music, and discovering new music. I've been a drummer for over
          ten years now and let me tell you there's nothing greater than letting
          off steam behind the drums or grooving along to a fun new song. The
          fellow in that picture is Buddy Rich, he was a prolific jazz drummer
          back in the 70's. His speed and style is still unmatched to this day.
          Whenever I want to inspire myself to improve my drumming I'll watch
          old videos of his drumming.
        </p>
        <p>
          As far as listening to music goes, my style is very eclectic. I'll
          listen to just about anything; heavy metal, jazz, rap, funk, japanese
          fusion jazz, etc. Yes I'll even listen to (some) country.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to be my best friend, send me your favorite song or band!

        <p>
          Swimming is a fairly new passion of mine, for the last 7 years I've
          been a couch for a youth team. Now I grew up in rural farm towns that
          didn't have access to a swim team. Now I took lessons when I was
          little so I've always loved the water, but I didn't know jack about
          competitive swimming or have any knowledge of technique. Fastforward
          to high school where I got my first summer job at the local gym. I was
          mainly a cleaner but I also helped the swim teachers with their
          classes.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I started coaching I had to study up on proper techniques and
          coaching practices, I've come a long way since then. The kids have
          started calling me the Fun Coach.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks to coaching I've develped a better sense of discipline and
          enjoyment. I push my swimmers but more importantly I make sure they're
          enjoying it and having fun. If we don't get any enjoyment out of what
          we do then we lose the drive to improve.

          Oh yeah I love video games! I'm taking a computer science class, why
          wouldn't I also enjoy one of the main appeals of having a computer?
        </p>
        <p>
          Gaming has helped me improve my problem-solving skills, group
          coordination, and helps me identify patterns. I've met a few of my
          dearest friends through these gaming communities, not that I have to
          be friends with whoever I work with but it's a nice bonus. Working
          together to overcome challenges makes the reward even greater.
